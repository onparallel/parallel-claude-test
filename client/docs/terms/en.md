## 12. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

- The Services are one of the most effective information gathering solutions in the market, and we keep improving it, however, the automation solutions have some limitations.
  We work hardly to improve our system's email deliverability for our customers, but there are certain causes that fall outside our scope of control.
  These are the main causes of response or deliverability failure:
- Recipients are ignoring our or your emails:
  If your recipient ignores completely our and/or your emails, it goes beyond our possibilities. We do not and never will contact your recipients except via email.
  Although improbable, if this is the case, it looks something personal. We suggest you calling your recipients to solve the situation.
- Emails sent to your recipients being tagged as spam:
  If your recipient's email server or client are tagging our system's emails as spam, your recipients may not see the message unless they access their spam folder.
  We are continuously improving our deliverability to avoid this from happening, however we cannot grant a perfect deliverability.
- Emails sent to your recipients blocking our domain account emails:
  If your recipient's email server or client block emails from our domain, your recipient may not see our email. We are constantly monitoring the deliverability of our emails and, if we detect this situation, we try to contact recipient's email administrators to unblock our emails.
- The User acknowledges and accepts that the use of the Website and the Service is at the User's own risk and under the User's responsibility and therefore PARALLEL does not accept any responsibility for misuse or use in breach of these Terms.
  The User will be responsible for any damages to PARALLEL resulting from the User's use of the Website and the Service in breach of the Terms.
- PARALLEL does not warrant the availability or continuity of the Website or the Service, its accuracy, reliability or completeness, or whether they are fit for a particular purpose. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, PARALLEL will not have any liability in this regard.
  As way of example and without limitation, PARALLEL shall not be liable for any damages that may result from:
  _ Interruptions, viruses, technical problems, interferences, omissions, unavailability, power cuts, failure of the telecommunication networks or the User's equipment which are not PARALLEL's responsibility.
  _ Delays or unavailability of the Website and the Service due to deficiencies or traffic overload on the Internet, in the communication network or the electricity grid.
  _ Third party actions.
  _ Unavailability of the Website and the Service due to maintenance or software updates. \* Anything which is beyond PARALLEL's direct control.
- SAVE FOR PARALLEL'S WILFUL MISCONDUCT, AND THOSE CASES IN WHICH DUE TO THE SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE USER INVOLVED OR THE NATURE OF THE MATTER, APPLICABLE LAW PROVIDES THAT LIABILITY CANNOT BE LIMITED BY AGREEMENT, USE OF THE WEBSITE AND THE SERVICE IS AT THE USER'S SOLE RISK AND PARALLEL SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGE OF ANY KIND CAUSED TO THE USER AS A RESULT OF USING THE WEBSITE OR THE SERVICES.
