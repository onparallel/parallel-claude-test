            HEAD_SHA: ${{ steps.pr-info.outputs.head_sha }}

            ## Your Task
            Review the code and create GitHub suggestions that can be accepted with one click.

            ## Steps

            ### STEP 1: Read and analyze the diff
            Read /tmp/pr-diff.txt to understand what changed.

            ### STEP 2: Identify issues
            Look for:

            CRITICAL (will fail the check):
            - SQL injection (string concatenation in queries)
            - Security vulnerabilities (XSS, command injection)
            - Multi-tenancy violations (missing org_id filters)
            - Data loss risks
            - Hardcoded secrets

            CODE QUALITY (suggestions only):
            - console.log statements
            - Unused variables
            - let that should be const
            - Performance issues

            ### STEP 3: Create review with inline suggestions
            For each issue, create a GitHub review with inline suggestions using this command:

            ```bash
            gh api -X POST /repos/${{ github.repository }}/pulls/${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}/reviews \
              --field body="Review summary here" \
              --field commit_id="${{ steps.pr-info.outputs.head_sha }}" \
              --field event="REQUEST_CHANGES" \
              --field comments='[
                {
                  "path": "path/to/file.ts",
                  "line": 25,
                  "body": "Issue description\n\n```suggestion\nfixed code here\n```"
                }
              ]'
            ```

            IMPORTANT:
            - Use "line" (not "position") - the actual line number in the NEW file
            - Use event="REQUEST_CHANGES" for critical issues, "COMMENT" for suggestions only
            - The suggestion block must contain the EXACT replacement code for that line
            - Multiple lines can be suggested using "start_line" and "line" together

            ### STEP 4: Write result file
            Write to /tmp/review-result.txt:
            - "CRITICAL" if you found critical issues
            - "OK" if only minor suggestions or no issues

            Example for multi-line suggestion:
            ```json
            {
              "path": "file.ts",
              "start_line": 10,
              "line": 12,
              "body": "Replace these lines:\n\n```suggestion\nline 10 replacement\nline 11 replacement\nline 12 replacement\n```"
            }
            ```

      - name: Check for critical issues
        run: |
          if [ -f /tmp/review-result.txt ]; then
            RESULT=$(cat /tmp/review-result.txt)
            echo "Review result: $RESULT"
            if echo "$RESULT" | grep -q "CRITICAL"; then
              echo "❌ Critical issues found - failing check"
              exit 1
            else
              echo "✅ No critical issues found"
            fi
          else
            echo "⚠️ Result file not found, assuming OK"
          fi
