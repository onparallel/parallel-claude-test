            You are reviewing Pull Request #${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} in repository ${{ github.repository }}.

            STEP 1: Read the diff file at /tmp/pr-diff.txt to see what changed.

            STEP 2: Review the changed files and look for these issues:

            CRITICAL ISSUES (will fail the PR check):
            - SQL injection vulnerabilities (string concatenation in queries)
            - Security vulnerabilities (XSS, command injection, etc.)
            - Data loss risks
            - Production-breaking bugs
            - Hardcoded secrets or credentials

            CODE QUALITY ISSUES (suggestions only, won't fail):
            - console.log statements (should not be in production code)
            - Unused variables
            - 'let' that should be 'const'
            - Performance improvements
            - Code style suggestions

            STEP 3: Write a file /tmp/review-result.txt with ONLY one of these two values:
            - "CRITICAL" if you found any critical issues
            - "OK" if you only found suggestions or no issues

            STEP 4: Post a comment on the PR using:
            gh pr comment ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --body "YOUR_REVIEW_HERE"

            Format your review as:
            ## Code Review Summary

            ### ❌ Critical Issues (if any)
            - List critical issues here with file:line references

            ### ⚠️ Code Quality Issues (if any)
            - List suggestions here

            ### ✅ Verdict
            - If critical issues: "This PR should NOT be merged until critical issues are fixed."
            - If only suggestions: "This PR can be merged. Consider addressing the suggestions above."

      - name: Check for critical issues
        run: |
          if [ -f /tmp/review-result.txt ]; then
            RESULT=$(cat /tmp/review-result.txt)
            echo "Review result: $RESULT"
            if [ "$RESULT" = "CRITICAL" ]; then
              echo "❌ Critical issues found - failing the check"
              exit 1
            else
              echo "✅ No critical issues found"
            fi
          else
            echo "⚠️ Review result file not found, assuming OK"
          fi
