            You are reviewing Pull Request #${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} in repository ${{ github.repository }}.

            STEP 1: Read the diff file at /tmp/pr-diff.txt to see what changed.

            STEP 2: Review the changed files and look for these issues:
            1. SQL injection vulnerabilities (string concatenation in queries) - CRITICAL
            2. console.log statements (should not be in production code)
            3. Unused variables
            4. 'let' that should be 'const' (when variable is never reassigned)
            5. Security issues

            STEP 3: After your analysis, post a comment on the PR using:
            gh pr comment ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --body "YOUR_REVIEW_HERE"

            Format your review as:
